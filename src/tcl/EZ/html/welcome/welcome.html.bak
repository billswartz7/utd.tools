<P>Welcome to the <B>EZlearn</B> teaching program.  <B>EZlearn</B> is
the easy to use interface to teach students various topics in Embedded
Systems and Computer Architecture. It uses a new concept in software
delivery called <A HREF="ddoc.html">Dynamic Documentation</A>. 
Applications are started and results are displayed within the documentation
and text. Documentation does not become outdated as the teaching applications
change. There is less context switching and faster learning. Yet the EZ
documentation system can now <A HREF=pdf.html>generate PDF and Postscript 
documents</A> so you can learn even when you are away from your
computer.</P>
<P>In addition, the system is open and all of the Tcl/Tk sources are provided.
