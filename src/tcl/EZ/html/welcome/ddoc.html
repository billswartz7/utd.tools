<H1><I>Dynamic Documentation</I></H1>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Dynamic Documentation</FONT></B><FONT
COLOR="#ff0000"></FONT> is the first <FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><I>active</I></FONT>
hypertext system for Integrated Circuit Place and Route Systems. Unlike other
passive help systems where documentation is added as an afterthought,
<B>Dynamic Documentation</B> *IS* an active documentation wizard which does the
work for you! But <B>Dynamic Documentation</B> is much more than just a wizard;
it is a system where the software and documentation are one. </P>
<P><B>Dynamic Documentation</B> is a revolutionary new graphical user interface
(GUI) which allows users of all levels, from beginners to experts, to
productively interact with a program. <B>Dynamic Documentation</B> supplies
precisely the right amount of documentation detail based on the user's
experience. Users will be led through the necessary documentation, and actually
execute the program from within the documentation itself! <B>Dynamic
Documentation </B> incorporates the latest advances in usability engineering,
passing knowledge directly to the user.</P>
<HR>
<H1><U>How it works</U></H1>
<P>This section describes a user's perspective of Dynamic Documentation. For a
technical discussion please <A HREF="technical.html#plugin">click here</A>.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Dynamic Documentation is written in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). Two
extensions to standard HTML are used, JavaScript and plugins. Both of these
extensions are available from the native browser. You must use the native
browser in order to unlock the power of Dynamic Documentation. </P>
<P>The native browser is based on the general purpose <A HREF="http://www.tcltk.com">
Tcl/Tk</A> interpreter. Tcl/Tk is an interpreted
scripting language for creating textual and graphical interfaces. 
Applications use Tcl/Tk user interfaces and they can be invoked and communicate
between themselves using Tcl/Tk. Learning Tcl is easy and we provide a list of 
<A HREF="reading.html">recommended books for Tcl</A>.</P>
<B>EZlearn</B> browser is written completely in Tcl/Tk augmented with
a Javascript interpreter. It is generally more stable than the Netscape's
browser but supports only features needed to implement Dynamic Documentation. 
</P>
<P>The other major function of Dynamic Documentation is to save and restore the
user's state. This allows users to start up EZ where it was last exited. The
state of design and display are stored in a number of Tcl variables. These
variables are written out to the &quot;~/.utdtools/eztcl.ini&quot; file whenever
they change. This file is read on startup. </P>
<HR>
<H3><U>Native Browser Graphical Interface</U></H3>
<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">This section only applies to <B>itools</B> native
browser</FONT></P>
<P>EZCAD graphical user interface is composed of seven major parts namely, the
main menu bar, the icon bar, the hypertext notebook, the hypertext display
window, the hypertext scrollbar, the current status bar, and the user message
area as shown in the picture below</P>
<P>. </P>
<CENTER>
<P><IMG SRC="gui.gif" ALIGN="center" WIDTH="609" HEIGHT="468"></P>
</CENTER>
<H4><U>The Main Menu Bar</U></H4>
<P>The main menu bar contains pull down submenus which allow the user to
execute commands. There are currently four pulldown menus in the menubar:
<B>File</B>, <B>Edit</B>, <B>Options</B>, and <B>Help</B>.</P>
<P>Here we unroll the <B>File</B> pulldown menu: </P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="file.gif" ALIGN="center" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="112"> 
</CENTER>
<P>The <B>Source Tcl</B> command is only available in <I>Developer</I> mode. It
allows the developer to source a Tcl file without leaving EZ CAD. This is a
productivity enhancement that allows the developer to write the Tk procedures
incrementally without having to exit the entire program.</P>
<P>The <B>Print</B> command is available in all user modes and prints the
contents of the currently displayed hypertext to a PostScript printer.</P>
<P>The <B>Exit</B> command terminates the EZ CAD program.</P>
<P>Now we present the <B>Edit</B> pulldown menu: </P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="edit.gif" ALIGN="center" WIDTH="119" HEIGHT="96"> 
</CENTER>
<P>The <B>Cut</B>, <B>Copy</B>, and <B>Paste</B> commands under the <B>Edit</B>
menu are only available in the <I>Developer</I> user mode during a hypertext
edit. Otherwise, these commands are inactive.</P>
<P>Now we unroll the <B>Options</B> pulldown menu: </P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="options.gif" ALIGN="center" WIDTH="138" HEIGHT="96"> 
</CENTER>
<P>The <B>Font Size</B> command changes the font size of the hypertext. The
cascade menu which is displayed offers <I>small</I>, <I>medium</I>, and
<I>large</I> fonts. The <B>Indent Amount</B> command modifies the indentation
distance for the display of ordered lists. Here too, the available choices are
<I>small</I>, <I>medium</I>, and <I>large</I>. The <B>User Mode</B> command
controls the current user knowledge level. The supported modes are
<B>Novice</B>, <B>Intermediate</B>, <B>Expert</B>, and <B>Developer</B>. Each
successive knowledge level allows the user access to more of the tools'
capabilities.</P>
<P>The final submenu, the <B>Help</B> pulldown menu: </P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="help.gif" ALIGN="center" WIDTH="253" HEIGHT="119"> 
</CENTER>
<P>The <B>Man Pages</B> command displays the Unix <B>man</B>ual pages from <I>Tcl</I>,
<I>Tk</I>, <I>Tix</I>, and section 1 of the Unix system. A file selection
dialog is presented and allows the user to determine the man page to display.
By changing the directory in the file selection dialog, this command can
display any man page on the system.  Compressed man pages are supported.

<P>The <B>Where Is It?</B> command performs a
search of the hypertext or editing window. The following window is presented to
the user:</P>
<CENTER>
<P><IMG SRC="where.gif" ALIGN="center" WIDTH="413" HEIGHT="292"></P>
</CENTER>
<P>The search string is entered on text entry area. A carriage command should
be entered in order to add the pattern to the history list. The pattern entered
may be either a regular expression or an exact search using glob style
matching. In addition, the search may be made case sensitive or insensitive.
The search is started by depressing the <B> &quot;Start Search&quot;</B>
button. The search may continue either forward or backward by depressing the
appropriate buttons. If no match is found you will be warned on the user
message line. The <B>Close</B> button removes the search engine from the
screen.</P>
<P></P>
<H4><U>The Icon Bar</U></H4>
<CENTER>
<P><IMG SRC="icons.gif" ALIGN="center" WIDTH="471" HEIGHT="47"></P>
</CENTER>
<P>The Icon Bar presents the often used commands to the user. The hypertext
traversal buttons - back and forward are prominently displayed in the icon bar.
Back revisits the previously visited hypertext links. If the user, traverses
backwards, they may return to their previous location by depressing the forward
icon. The <B>Reload</B> icon is used to redisplay the current hypertext
document. If the user was viewing or editing the source of the hypertext,
source is replaced with the rendering of it. The <B>Home</B> icon redisplays
the entry point HTML for the current topic denoted by the raised tab. It allows
the easy traversal to the top of the current topic. The <B>Search</B> mode
renders the search hypertext system in order to find a topic. The <B>View</B>
or <B>Edit</B> icon allows the user to view and edit the hypertext source
respectively. The <B>Edit</B> icon is available only in the
<I>&quot;Developer&quot;</I> user mode; otherwise, the <B>View</B> icon is
presented. The <B>Save</B> icon is only available in
<I>&quot;Developer&quot;</I> mode and saves the current copy of the hypertext
source. The original hypertext source is renamed to <I>filename</I>.orig. The
<B>Stop</B> icon stops the rendering of the current HTML. </P>
<P></P>
<H4><U>The Hypertext Display</U></H4>
<P>The hypertext display consists of the <B>Tix</B> notebook, the main
hypertext window, and its accompanying scrollbar. The key feature to the
hypertext display is the ability to access the documentation both sequentially
and randomly. The tabs on the notebook choose the general topic of interest
whereas the scrollbar permits sequential access of the current document. It is
this power to access documentation both sequentially and randomly that makes
<B>Dynamic Documentation</B> a leader in usability engineering.</P>
<P></P>
<H4><U>User Feedback</U></H4>
<P>The current status bar, and the user message area are designed to give the
user feedback during interaction session. The current status bar has two
messages: <B><FONT COLOR="green">Ready </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="green"></FONT>
and <B><FONT COLOR="red">Busy</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="red"></FONT>. The
<B>busy</B> message indicates that the program is executing and that the user
should wait before entering a new command. It should be noted that the system
periodically displays the incompletely drawn hypertext in order to inform the
user of its progress. The <B>ready</B> message indicates that EZ CAD is waiting
for its next command.</P>
<P>The user message area displays messages from the execution of the hypertext.
Normal messages are displayed with a foreground color of black, warning
messages are displayed with a foreground color of blue, and error messages are
displayed in red. The message area is <I>persistent</I>, that is, the message
remains displayed until another message occurs to overwrite it.</P>
<P></P>
<HR>
<H4><U>Summary</U></H4>
<P>We have presented a revolutionary new active hypertext documentation system
and graphical user interface. This system understands different user knowledge
levels, actively integrates the program into the documentation, and
incorporates the latest research in usability engineering.</P>
