<BLOCKQUOTE><P>One of the most useful functions performed by the
<CODE>unknown</CODE> procedure is <I>autoloading</I>. Autoloading allows you to
write collections of Tcl procedures and place them in script files in library
directories. You can then use these procedures in your Tcl applications without
having to <CODE>source</CODE> the files that define them explicitly. You simply
invoke the procedures. The first time that you invoke a library procedure it
won't exist, so <CODE>unknown</CODE> will be called. <CODE>unknown</CODE> will
find the file that defines the procedure, <CODE>source</CODE> the file to
define the procedure, and then reinvoke the original command. The next time the
procedure is invoked it will exist, so the autoloading mechanism won't be
triggered. </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Autoloading provides two benefits. First, it makes it easy to
build large libraries of useful procedures and use them in Tcl scripts. You
need not know exactly which files to <CODE>source</CODE> to define which
procedures, since the autoloader takes care of that for you. The second benefit
of autoloading is efficiency. Without autoloading an application must
<CODE>source</CODE> all of its scripts when it starts. Autoloading allows an
application to start up without loading any script files at all; the files will
be loaded later when their procedures are needed, and some files may never be
loaded at all. Thus autoloading reduces the startup time and saves memory. </P>
