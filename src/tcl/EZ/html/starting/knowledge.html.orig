<P>EZlearn allows users of all levels of expertise to use <B>utdtools</B>
effectively. Currently, there are four levels of expertice: Novice,
Intermediate, Expert, and Developer. The interface is simplified for Novices
and explanations are as detailed as possible. No advanced options are available
to the Novice. The Intermediate interface allows more options to the
<B>utdtools</B> programs. The Expert mode allows the user access to all options
to <B>utdtools</B>. The Developer mode allows the user to modify the hypertext in
order to customize it for their own application. Reread this document in expert
mode for more details on how to enter the Developer mode.</P>
<SCRIPT>JS_COND(expr="$EZUSER==Expert||$EZUSER==Developer",
HTML="<P><FONT COLOR=red>In order to enter <I>\"Developer\"</I> mode, you need 
to set the EZDEVELOPER environment variable in the shell before executing EZlearn. 
For example, using csh you would enter:</FONT></P><P><CODE><B><CENTER>setenv EZDEVELOPER 1</CENTER></B></CODE></P>
<P>This extra step insures that ordinary users don't change modes and accidently modify the hypertext.</P>") ;
