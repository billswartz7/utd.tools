<P>The EZlearn system consists of a set of programs which are Tcl programmable.
The system may be extended by the users to suit their needs.  The system
contains two types of Tcl commands : <I>builtin</I> commands and Tcl 
procedures or <I>procs</I>.  In order to document the available commands 
for each tool, an <I>autohelp</I> facillity has been built into each of the
tools.  You may access the <I>autohelp</I> facillity while in the graphics
mode.   You will find it under the <I>Help</I> menu that you find at
the upper right corner of the graphics window.  After choosing the 
<I>Commands</I> option, you will be presented with a window displaying
the available commands in the current tool.</P>

<P>Each line contains the name of the command followed by its type.  The
user may receive more information for each command by double clicking
on the desired line.   If the command is a <I>builtin</I> command, the command
will be executed with the <I>-help</I> argument and the result presented
in the transcript window.  If the command is a Tcl procedure, the source
for the command will be presented in a scrollable text window.</P>

<P>At the bottom of the <I>Command Help</I> window are two buttons :
<I>Dismiss</I> and <I>Load All Commands</I>.  The <I>Dismiss</I> button
will exit the <I>Command Help</I> window.  The <I>Load All Commands</I>
will load all Tcl procedures into the list of commands.  Normally, the
Tcl procedures are <I>auto-loaded</I>, that is, they are only loaded when they
are reference.  This makes the program load faster since only the minimal
set of Tcl commands are loaded.  However, the user may wish to see all
of the available commands.  The <I>Load All Commands</I> function will
load all of the Tcl files into the program and then display them.</P>
