PROBLEM:
In this question, you will need to create a simple  program
that will use a library to compute the Fibonacci series of
the following number 

   UTDx{Fibonacci},

and then perform the following operation
 
   UTDx{Fibop}.
 
The name of the library function should called:

   UTDfibronacci and should have the following prototype

extern double UTDfibronacci( int number ) ;

which should reside in the header file: utdfib.h.

To identify the program instance, add the following line 
to the top of your program:

fprintf( stderr, "PROGRAMID: UTDx{UTDID}\n" ) ;
You are  to output the answer on a single line followed by 
a new line.  The output should be printed to the screen 
using two digits of precision after the decimal place.
You should output to stderr rather than stdout, that is, 
use
 
 fprintf ( stderr, format_string, ... )  
 
as a mechanism to output the answer.  You should use the following
template for your answer:

"ANSWER: %.2lf\n"
 
If your answer is an integer, cast it to a double.
All floating point operations should be done in double precision.

Put your library function in a file called utdfib.c or utdfib.cpp 
containing you library function.   This file should include a
include to the file utdfib.h.

Put your main or calling program in a file called 'problem2.c' or
'problem2.cpp' if you wish to write using C++.   The name of the
program must be called problem2.
 
Build a makefile for your program.  The name of the file should be
'Makefile' and exist in the current working directory.   It should
create a UTDx{libtype} library named 
UTDx{libname} with the proper suffix.
