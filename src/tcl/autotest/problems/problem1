OUTPUT:ANSWER: %.2lf\n
PROBLEM:
In this question, you will need to create a simple  program
that will process data. You are given the following data:
 
   UTDx{D1},
   UTDx{D2},
   UTDx{D3},
   UTDx{D4},
   UTDx{D5},
   UTDx{D6}
 
Write a programs that adds them together and then process 
the sum by then doing UTDx{Doperation}
 
To identify the program instance, add the following line to the
top of your program:

fprintf( stderr, "PROGRAMID: UTDx{UTDID}\n" ) ;
 
You should initially put the values in an array.  You are  to output the
answer on a single line followed by a new line.  The output should be
printed to the screen using two digits of  precision after the decimal place.
You should output to stderr  rather than stdout, that is, use
 
 fprintf ( stderr, format_string, ... )  
 
as a mechanism to output the answer.  You should use the following
template for your answer:

"ANSWER: %.2lf\n"
 
If your answer is an integer, cast it to a double.
All floating point operations should be done in double precision.

Put all of your code in a single file called 'problem1.c' or
'problem1.cpp' if you wish to write using C++.   The name 
of the program must be called problem1.
 
Build a makefile for your program.  The name of the file should be
'Makefile' and exist in the current working directory.
