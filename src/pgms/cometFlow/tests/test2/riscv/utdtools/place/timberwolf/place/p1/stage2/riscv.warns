WARNING[init_parasitics]:Capacitance values cannot be normalized.
   Timing driven placement cannot be performed only wire length minimization.
   If you intent to run timing driven placement, please check the .par
   file for layer capacitances equal to 0.0.


WARNING[pinlayers_init]:pin_layers not defined.
Using first vertical layer:M1 pitch:0.03600 offset:0.01800
WARNING[auto_wire_weight]:The vertical wire weight has calculated a large number
using auto_wire_weight which may cause the results to suffer.
If this is due to a small row separation, the problem may be eliminated
by turning auto_wire_weight to off in the .par file.
WARNING[auto_wire_weight]:vertical wire weight reset to 1.0.
WARNING[SApad_place]:Pad ring given in error.
Given padring   : (0,0) (27.18000,27.36000).
Adjusted padring: (-0.12925,-0.12925) (27.18000,27.48925).
